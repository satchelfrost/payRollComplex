## Change boring excel data into a beautiful Microsoft word doc

This program is a more complex payroll document generator because it is based off of a real payroll
from a restaurant (all names are fake in the excel document to protect peoples' identities).

It asked to choose which employee, the dates that they worked from, and it then generates (automatically) a word document
with hours logged, wages, and a place for the employee to sign.
